This is a semester project for the Intro to Software Engineering course in Fall 2022. Our tema Bugz created a bike rental website based on the local bike service. The website is based on the provided prototype, and is built with Ruby on Rails. 

We applied MVC design pattern, iStar model, and Agile practices throughout the semester to mimic real-world software development practices.

The parts I focused on were frontend design and general debugging.

I added a pink color theme and different small icons to make the using experience more delightsful, and incorporated human-centered design by adding features like adjustable windows for mobile friendly view.

We applied Stripe that enables real-world checkout experience as follows:

We also applied Google Map API with cute bike icons. Unfortunately, because of Google Map renovation we need to update payment to enable view, which is unfortunately lost now :(

You are very welcome to visit the github page:[Valetbike by Bugz](https://github.com/sofilincc/valetbike) and look at the cute interface on your server, try signup for a membership, and play with the adjustable windows!
