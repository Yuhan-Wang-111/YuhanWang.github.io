[Valetbike by Bugz](https://github.com/sofilincc/valetbike)

Applied MVC design pattern, iStar model, and Agile practices to maintain sustainable project development

Incorporated human-centered design by adding features like adjustable windows for mobile friendly view; applied Google Map API and Stripe that enables real-world rental experience

Note: screenshot is from a prototype, the minimum viable product is a little funcier. Unfortunately the github repo is not working. When it's back, I will update the cover :))
