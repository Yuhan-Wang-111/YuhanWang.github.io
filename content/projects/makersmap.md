[Makers Map](https://smithmakersmaps.com/) is an interactive map for Smith students to navigate makerspace on campus! You can apply different filters and search for locatino, contact, accessibility, and more. 

I updated this website during my internship at the Design Thinking Initiative in the summer of 2022 with Angular and Typescript.
