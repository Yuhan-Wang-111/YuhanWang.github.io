This page contains some *plots* that I enjoy or find beautiful.

I have worked with data analysis and machine learning from Summer 2023, and as I am passionate about visual elements, I want to include some plots I generated that are *visually pleasing* here. This is also a space to showcase my potential in data visualization.

And the plot of its gradient magnitude

I definitely love its bewildering effect :)

Here is a plot of some point glouds in a space. We want all the point clouds to be normalized into one scale, so we used different colors for each point clouds. Even though they are layering on top of each other, you can see that they are acutally *normalized*!

Now the below one is a real piece of art (actually a wrong version but art!)
