This post is to cherish my favorite place that has brought fundamental impact on me-- the [Design Thinking Initiative](https://www.smith.edu/academics/design-thinking)(DTI). It's a makerspace. I had a website internship there in the summer of 2022, and then continued to work as a studio design partner.

DTI is really a great source of inspiration for me. In fact, it's the place that really lead me to consider myself as a maker, appreciate handicraft skills, and improve the small parts of life through design.

* The cover photo is a blender model I created based on the classroom of DTI, which is preserved at the [Smith ScholarWorks](https://scholarworks.smith.edu/other_projects/224/).

* During the summer internship, I helped maintain the [Smith Makers Map](https://smithmakersmaps.com/).

* Many of my [creations](https://www.instagram.com/yaaaarth/) are made at DTI.

I really appreciate this place and am privileged to have the chance working with a group of inspiring, supportive, innovative makers who care about welcoming everyone and [making the place accessible for everyone.](https://www.smith.edu/news-events/news/designing-all) 

Not meant to brag but hey, I work at the DTI ❤️️
